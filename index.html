    <p>Claude Monet was born in Paris in 1940. At the age of five, he moved with his family to a coastal town in northern France. 
        In this idyllic location, Monet's artistic creativity flourished. When he was 16, one year after the death of his mother, 
        he met the French landscape painter Eugene Boudin. Boudin was the first person to introduce Monet to outdoor painting in 
        the open air. Monet was enthralled and over the next 70 years perfected his Impressionistic style of painting and produced 
        some of the world's most recognizable and sought-after pieces of art.</p>

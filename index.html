    <p>Claude Monet was born in Paris in 1940. At the age of five, he moved with his family to a coastal town in northern France. 
        In this idyllic location, Monet's artistic creativity flourished. When he was 16, one year after the death of his mother, 
        he met the French landscape painter Eugene Boudin. Boudin was the first person to introduce Monet to outdoor painting in 
        the open air, know as 'en plein air'. Monet was enthralled and over the next 70 years perfected his Impressionistic style of painting and produced 
        some of the world's most recognizable and sought-after pieces of art.</p>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>From an early age, Monet was learning about art. He attended a secondary school that was focused on the arts before 
            continuing his education with artists like Ochard, Boudin, Jongkind, Degas, Cezanne, and Pissarro. Throughout his 20’s, 
            Monet embedded himself into the art community, developing relationships with other artists like Manet, Renoir, Sisley and Bazille.</p> 
            <p>
            In 1870, Monet married his first wife and moved to the Netherlands. Some of Monet’s first notable works were created there. 
            Upon returning to France later that year, Monet purchased a floating studio and continued to paint the landscapes around him. 
            He also developed strong relationships with fellow artists who worked together to create their own art organization and exhibits. 
            It was at their first exhibit that the term, “Impressionism” was coined by a critical art reviewer who was not fond of the work 
            he saw there on display, including one painting by Monet titled Impression.</p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>Monet was known for his brushwork which was composed of short, thick strokes using a flat filbert tipped brush. His goal was to capture 
            the light in his paintings and show how light altered the subject matter over the course of the day. He would paint dozens and sometimes hundreds of canvases 
            of the same subject matter in order to capture it at all different times of the day and throughout different seasons.</p>
